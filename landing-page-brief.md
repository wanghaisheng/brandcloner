# BrandCloner - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

BrandCloner is a web-based SaaS tool designed to help marketers and product teams quickly and accurately clone the styles of any brand's website for conversion testing purposes. The tool allows users to input any URL, instantly extract and clone the site's design elements, download ready-to-use files, make content modifications, and deploy to Cloudflare for A/B testing. This enables users to test their products in different brand environments to find the most effective conversion setting without the need for extensive design or development resources.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Digital marketers conducting A/B testing and conversion optimization
- Growth teams looking to test products in various brand environments
- SaaS companies wanting to test landing page variations quickly
- E-commerce businesses optimizing product pages
- Startup founders with limited design resources

### User Pain Points
1. **Time-Consuming Design Process**: Manually recreating a brand's style can take weeks of development time
2. **Technical Expertise Required**: Traditional methods require advanced CSS and HTML knowledge
3. **Legal Concerns**: Uncertainty about copyright issues when copying brand elements for testing
4. **Difficult Iteration Process**: Making changes to test different variations requires rebuilding
5. **Limited Design Resources**: Small teams often lack dedicated designers for conversion testing

## Core Value Proposition

BrandCloner dramatically reduces the time and technical expertise needed to test products within different brand environments. Instead of spending weeks manually recreating brand styles or hiring developers, users can clone any brand's style in seconds, make necessary modifications, and deploy for testing - all without deep technical expertise.
